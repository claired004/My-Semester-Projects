Users are also allowed to add personal recipes that may not be already in the list, customizing their list for future uses. 

Key Features:
- Users can add a custom recipe by inputting a name, list of ingredients, and cooking time
- Users can fiter recipes by the amount of cooking time they have in minutes. It outputs all recipes that match their specified time.



Google Project:

Key Features:
- Compares each guess to the secret number
- If all guesses are incorrect, the program displays the correct answer at the end

Slot Machine Project:
This program mimics a slot machine game. Players start with 100 credits and can spin to match the symbals in the games. Depending on the result of the spin, the player could win or lose correspondingly. The game continues until the player quits or runs out of credits.

- Randomly chooses three symbols for each spin
- If the slots lands on three 7s, the credit is multiplied by 7
- If there are no matches in the slots, the user loses 5 credits
- Credits are updates after each spin, adapting to the outcomes of the spin
- The loop ends when the play selects to "quit"
